-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
speed: StringBuffer > StringBuilder > String
use: String (when data is not changing)
     StringBuilder (when context switching is not in picture)
     StringBuffer (when context switching is there as well as value is getting updated)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immutable --> when values get updated, rather than updating it will create new value in memory and if old is not referenced
            by any of variable. It will remove by garbage collector.

Mutable --> when values get updated, it will update that value in that given place.

Thread safe --> Thread safety refers to the property of a program or a piece of code that allows it to be executed by
                multiple threads concurrently without causing unexpected or erroneous behavior. In a multithreaded environment,
                where multiple threads are accessing and possibly modifying shared data, ensuring thread safety is crucial to
                prevent data corruption, race conditions, and other synchronization issues.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String --> Immutable & not thread safe
* String literals
  String name="roshan"; //Memory address: Ox29
  String name2="roshan"; //Memory address: Ox29

  Key points:
  --> If values are created using String literals, then value are created in String Pool. Suppose if value is already present
      than it will point only rather than creating.
  --> If multiple variable pointing to same value present in String Pool. Suppose one of the variable's value got changed then there
      it will create new value in String Pool.

* By using New Keyword
  String name = new String("Roshan"); //Memory address: Ox32
  String name2 = new String("Roshan"); //Memory address: Ox652

  Key Points:
  --> If values are created using new Keyword, then there value are created in String Pool and in heap as well.
  --> Memory address of the both the value will be different.
  --> If any variable creates the same value which is already present in memory than there also one more value will be created in heap
      But Where as in String Pools it will point only.

StringBuilder --> mutable,  Heap & all methods are not synchronized and not thread safe.

StringBuffer --> mutable, Heap & all methods are synchronized and are thread safe.
